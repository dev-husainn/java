/* --------------------------------- Variables ------------------------------- */

/*Java Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false


To declare more than one variable of the same type, you can use a comma-separated list:->


Instead of writing:-

int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);
You can simply write:

int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);
